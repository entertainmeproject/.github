## Introduction
In the 2023 World Happiness Report, Indonesia is ranked 84th out of 109 countries in terms of happiness. Around 47.23% of Indonesia's population feels unhappy. 
At the Southeast Asian level, Indonesian people's happiness level is ranked sixth out of the nine countries studied. 
According to the Global Change Data Lab survey and analysis of time use in 34 countries, one factor influencing people's happiness and life satisfaction is having enough time for leisure. 
However, finding leisure activities that we like can become challenging and time-consuming. Time that should be used for leisure is instead used up looking for suitable entertainment. 
So, how can we help people find suitable entertainment more quickly and precisely? <br />
We introduce EntertainMe, an **application designed to help discover and schedule entertainment while providing tools to monitor stress levels.** 
EntertainMe aims to minimize the resources needed to find suitable leisure activities by offering personalized recommendations to help users improve their well-being and life satisfaction.
